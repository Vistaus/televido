# Mediathek

**Mediathek** lets you livestream, search, play and download media from German-language public television services. It is powered by [MediathekViewWeb](https://mediathekviewweb.de/)'s API and the [Zapp backend](https://github.com/mediathekview/zapp-backend) API which are both part of the [MediathekView](https://mediathekview.de/) project.

## Channel logos

The ARD, ORF and SRF logos were taken from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org) and are in the public domain.

The other channel logos were extracted from the source code of [zapp](https://github.com/mediathekview/zapp) and converted to SVG using [`vd2svg`](https://github.com/seanghay/vector-drawable-svg).
