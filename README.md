# Televido

**Televido** (“Television” in Esperanto) lets you livestream, search, play and download media from German-language public television services. It is powered by [MediathekViewWeb](https://mediathekviewweb.de/)'s API and the [Zapp backend](https://github.com/mediathekview/zapp-backend) API which are both part of the [MediathekView](https://mediathekview.de/) project.

The presented content is provided directly by the respective television services, this program only facilitates finding and accessing the shows.

For video playback, Televido uses external video players that are installed on the user's system. Currently supported players: [GNOME Videos (Totem)](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.Totem), [Celluloid](https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.celluloid_player.Celluloid), [Clapper](https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.rafostar.Clapper).

## Channel logos

The ARD, ORF and SRF logos were taken from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org) and are in the public domain.

The other channel logos were extracted from the source code of [zapp](https://github.com/mediathekview/zapp) and converted to SVG using [`vd2svg`](https://github.com/seanghay/vector-drawable-svg).
